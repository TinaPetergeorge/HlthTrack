# GoldenHackProject
Inspiration
Our inspiration behind the project was to help clients have an easier way to access their own health care at any given time. We started off this journey by imagining people who have a hard time remembering and bringing all their medical documents to the doctors office. For eg, we thought of elderly people who have many health concerns and need constant access to their documents.

What it does
Our app sets up the clients with a database where the can themselves change,create and acess all their medical documents on the go.

How we built it
we used node, express, firebase, socket.io on the backend and react on the frontend.
